\tab - File Ninja - 110\par
\tab\tab\b0 Message:  "One of our new employees has stopped showing up to work. We think he took the job just to steal our flag, but we have no idea how he got it off his work laptop - we blocked access to most of the internet except developer specific sites. See if you can figure out how he got the flag off the system by analyzing a image of his laptop's filesystem."\par

\tab\tab File:  backup.iso\par
\tab\tab Flag:  flag\{g1t_15_c0mplex_pbtrg3hv6d\}\par
\tab\tab Solution:  I looked around for a bit in the backup.iso file on Windows, dropping random files in Notepad++.  I eventually dropped the .iso file in Kali and extracted it to a separate file.  I ran the command "grep -r flag [extracted backup.iso folder]".  Scrolling through, in DOCUMENT/WORK_FOL/_GIT/CONFIG the line of text "flag = ZmxhZ3tnMXRfMTVfYzBtcGxleF9wYnRyZzNodjZkfQ==" popped up at the end.  I tried dropping it in the answer box as it was but didn't work.  I then remembered the hing about base64 encoding and used base64decode.org to decode the flag and got the above flag as the answer.\par

\tab\tab\b0 Message: "Decrypt the ciphertext!"\par
\tab\tab File: cipher.txt\par
\tab\tab Solution: \par
\tab\tab\tab Googled the N and e and found a lot of results talking about 65537 being used in RSA so I looked for a tool to decipher RSA with just the N and e and found the below tool.  Once installed on my Kali box, I ran ./RsaCtfTool.py --uncipher [the cipher text] -n [the N] -e [the e] and got an error about the ciphertext not being an INT base 10.  Looking at it I saw a's, b's, c's, d's, e's and f's and figured it was probably in hex.  So, I converted to decimal and reran the command and got a bunch of "\\x00"'s and the below key at the end of it all.\b\par

\tab\tab\tab I Googled "free ip bulk list geolocation" and found the below address and pasted all the IPs from the file into the site.  At the very bottom is a "Host distribution by country" pie chart and Brazil was the largest piece.\par
