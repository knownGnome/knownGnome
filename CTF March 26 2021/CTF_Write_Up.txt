		Flag (Unattempted):  'A lot of hacking is playing with other people, you know, getting them to do strange things.' - Steve Wozniak
		Solution:  Looking at the encryption algorithm in enc.txt, it looked a lot like C, based on the use of pointers and syntax.  I created a simple C program skeleton to start, using Eclipse.  Including stdio.h and stdlib.h since they are most commonly used headers.  In main I created variables for secret, plain, p and c.  I zeroed out secret and plain, pasted the encryption function in the program and then printed out plain and secret after the encryption so see what would happen.  I noticed in the encrypted text, that there was a repeating pattern to the it.  I proceeded to create a second FOR loop for decryption, and printing out the decrypted text.  I commented out all the lines in the encryption loop and added them back in, one operation at a time.  Every operation I uncommented, I would try and figure out the opposite and add it to the decryption loop.  About halfway through I started having problems where the it was decrypting back to plain text.  I came to the realization I had to put the last operation in the encryption loop as the first in the decryption loop, e.g. work bottom up from the encryption loop.  I would eventually settle on the following code segment.
	for(int i=0;i<112;i+=4){
		c =  (unsigned int *) &(secret[i]);
		*c ^= 0xdeadbeef;
		*c =
				((*c >> 24) | 0xffffff00) &
				((*c >> 8)  | 0xffff00ff) &
				((*c << 8)  | 0xff00ffff) &
				((*c << 24) | 0x00ffffff);
		*c = (*c ^ 0Xffffffff);
	}
This code segment returned the bytes back to the original zeroed out array I was using to test with.  I then added the secret array in named "char secret2[112]", which I set as the secret and  text and did the same process as above, print it out, decrypt it, and see what I got.  I used the following code segment.
printf("\n\n\nEncrypted Text");
	printf("\n");
	for(int i=0;i<112;i+=1){
		counter++;
		printf("%x", secret2[i]);
	}

	for(int i=0;i<112;i+=4){
		c =  (unsigned int *) &(secret2[i]);
		*c ^= 0xdeadbeef;

		*c =
				((*c >> 24) | 0xffffff00) &
				((*c >> 8)  | 0xffff00ff) &
				((*c << 8)  | 0xff00ffff) &
				((*c << 24) | 0x00ffffff);

		*c = (*c ^ 0Xffffffff);

	}

	printf("\n\nDecrypted Text");
	printf("\n");
	for(int i=0;i<112;i+=1){
		counter++;
		printf("%x", secret2[i]);
	}

The above code segment produced "2741206c6f74206f66206861636b696e6720697320706c6179696e672077697468206f746865722070656f706c652c20796f75206b6e6f772c2067657474696e67207468656d20746f20646f20737472616e6765207468696e67732e27202d20537465766520576f7a6e69616b000" from the decryption.  I noticed a lot of the values were in the same range.  I looked at an Ascii table and it looked like the first several values all fell in the printable range of characters.  I wrote another print statement, but formated it as a character instead of hex.

The above the print statement produced the following "'A lot of hacking is playing with other people, you know, getting them to do strange things.' - Steve Wozniak "

		File:  backup.iso
		Flag:  flag{g1t_15_c0mplex_pbtrg3hv6d}
		Solution:  I looked around for a bit in the backup.iso file on Windows, dropping random files in Notepad++.  I eventually dropped the .iso file in Kali and extracted it to a separate file.  I ran the command "grep -r flag [extracted backup.iso folder]".  Scrolling through, in DOCUMENT/WORK_FOL/_GIT/CONFIG the line of text "flag = ZmxhZ3tnMXRfMTVfYzBtcGxleF9wYnRyZzNodjZkfQ==" popped up at the end.  I tried dropping it in the answer box as it was but didn't work.  I then remembered the hing about base64 encoding and used base64decode.org to decode the flag and got the above flag as the answer.

		Message: "Decrypt the ciphertext!"
		File: cipher.txt
		Solution: 
			Googled the N and e and found a lot of results talking about 65537 being used in RSA so I looked for a tool to decipher RSA with just the N and e and found the below tool.  Once installed on my Kali box, I ran ./RsaCtfTool.py --uncipher [the cipher text] -n [the N] -e [the e] and got an error about the ciphertext not being an INT base 10.  Looking at it I saw a's, b's, c's, d's, e's and f's and figured it was probably in hex.  So, I converted to decimal and reran the command and got a bunch of "\x00"'s and the below key at the end of it all.
